# WELCOME TO KINAPS BRAIN

**Kinaps Brain** enables you to create your own knowledge base that you can query in natural language. Pretty much like ChatGPT but with your own knowledge.

To build your knowledge base, simply upload documents with trusted information (information that you consider as a reference) using the attachment button in the chat interface. You can upload documents such as PDFs, DOCXs, and PPTXs.

There is one knowledge base per user. It can be a good idea to use one or more threads to upload documents and other threads to ask questions. This way, you can find back easily source documents.

You can ask questions about the knowledge contained in the documents but also be more creative. For instance, if your source documents are teaching material, you can ask Kinaps Brain to create exercises that will put in practice the knowledge contained in the teaching material.

Just try it out for yourself and have fun !
